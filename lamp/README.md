# Lamp

My father built two replacement lamps for a friend's driveway gate. He glued them out of 3.2×74mm plastic strips and asked me to draw and print a fitting lampshade in transparent PETG.

## Lampshade

The lampshade is a hollow cuboid measuring 74×74×63mm with a wall thickness of 3.2mm. The top face of the cuboid is open.


## Slicing

I slice using the latest Slic3r Prusa Edition. I suggest using 0.20mm layer height. I use 100% infill.

## Printing

Printed with an Original Prusa i3 Mk3 using transparent PETG
