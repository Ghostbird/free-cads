# Pulsteknik PGM 15 AA

I'm not actually sure whether this name is 100% correct. This is a device that consists of a horizontal drum with 15 columns of 75 slots each. The drum is rotated by a motor at a constant speed. On top of the device are 15 single pole double throw microswitches that can be pressed by bits inserted in the slots on the drum. In short, you can create a program that controls 15 microswitches with a looping pattern of 75 “frames”.

## The bit

The bit is an insertable piece of plastic. Once the bit is inserted into the drum and rotates under one of the 15 arms, the corresponding microswitch is pressed. The original bit was symmetrical with the wider part protruding .65mm on both sides. In my version I made one side of the bit completely flat to make it easier to print.

The original bit was 1.6mm thick, but I noticed that when I printed at that thickness, the result was closer to 1.8mm thick, and would not fit. Therefore I made my version of the bit 1.4mm thick. That version fits well. In fact, it is a much better fit than the original bits I have. The PLA bit is much “snappier” and requires slightly more force to pull out of the slot than the original.


## Slicing

I slice using the latest Slic3r Prusa Edition. I suggest using 0.20mm layer height. I used 100% infill, though I'm not sure whether the model actually has any parts that are considered infill. After the first successful print, I printed 135 (15×9) copies at once, the maximum numer that I could auto-arrange on my print bed using Slic3r.

## Printing

Printed with an Original Prusa i3 Mk3 using PLA
