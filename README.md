Free 3D CAD models by me

## Licence

MIT licence

## More information

Each subfolder should have its own README.md file detailing the model(s)

Note: I am a self-taught FreeCAD user and my experience is counted in hours rather than days. Do not be surprised if some models are highly unoptimal, or unnecessarily hard to edit due to my lack of experience with any CAD workflow.
